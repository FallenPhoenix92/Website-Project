            <p>I am your basic gamer lad, I love RPG's mainly but I am prone to 
                FPS's, Stratergies, and even a good Story game.
                </p>
                <p>I have Autistic Spectrum Disorder, which basically means my head
                    processes information differently and I often misunderstand alot
                    of things. I also suffer with Anxiety and Moderate Depression so it's
                    difficult some days but I try my best to make the best of things.

            <p class="ava">My Phoenix came about from World of Warcraft. back in the Cataclysm 
                (4th Expansion) days, they introduced Guild Levels & Rewards and the
                Final Reward was a Dark Phoenix Mount whic I immediately fell in love with.
                I always called myself Phoenix in my games but I wanted something unique and
                cool, and a Fallen Phoenix was born!
